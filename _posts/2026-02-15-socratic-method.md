The Socratic method remains the dominant pedagogical form in American law schools, but it is widely misunderstood—both by its defenders and its critics.

## What Socrates Actually Did

The original Socratic method was not about cold-calling students. It was a collaborative inquiry aimed at exposing hidden assumptions and working toward truth together. The law school version—a professor questioning a student in front of the class—retains the form but often loses the spirit.

## The Good

When done well, Socratic dialogue forces students to articulate their reasoning in real time. It builds the habit of thinking on one's feet, tolerating ambiguity, and recognizing when an argument proves too much.

## The Not So Good

When done poorly, Socratic questioning becomes a performance of dominance rather than a genuine inquiry. Students learn to avoid saying anything falsifiable rather than to think more carefully.

## Toward a Better Pedagogy

The best law school classrooms combine Socratic elements with collaborative problem-solving, explicit instruction, and regular low-stakes feedback. The method works best when students feel psychologically safe enough to be genuinely wrong.
