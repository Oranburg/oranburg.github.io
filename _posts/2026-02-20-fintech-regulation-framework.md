As financial technology reshapes lending, payments, and investment, regulators face a difficult question: adapt existing rules or build new ones from scratch?

## The Challenge of Regulatory Fit

Traditional financial regulation was designed for a world of brick-and-mortar institutions and paper-based transactions. Fintech disrupts both the products and the delivery channels that regulations were designed to govern.

## A Three-Part Framework

When evaluating how existing law applies to a new fintech product, it helps to ask three questions:

1. **Function over form.** Does this product perform the economic function of a regulated instrument, even if it uses novel technology?
2. **Consumer harm.** Does the product create risks of the type that the underlying regulatory regime was meant to prevent?
3. **Systemic risk.** Could widespread adoption of this product create risks for the financial system as a whole?

## Implications for Practice

Lawyers advising fintech startups should encourage early regulatory engagement, not regulatory avoidance. The companies that have thrived long-term are those that built compliance into the product from the beginning.
