Welcome, and thank you for visiting. This blog is a space for thinking out loud about law, philosophy, and the craft of legal education.

## What to Expect

Posts here will cover three broad themes that map to the main sections of this site:

- **Philosophy** — Questions about why we have laws, whether they are just, and how different jurisprudential traditions answer those questions.
- **Teaching** — Practical and theoretical reflections on what it means to teach law well, from Socratic method to experiential learning.
- **Podcast** — Show notes, transcripts, and supplementary reading for podcast episodes.

Posts will vary in length. Some will be short observations; others will be longer essays that work through an argument in detail.

## How This Works

Each post is a plain-text Markdown file in the `_posts` folder of this repository. That means the writing process can happen anywhere—including [iA Writer](https://ia.writer/)—and the site is just a static Jekyll build hosted on GitHub Pages.

<details>
<summary>Example: Embed a video or talk (click to expand)</summary>

<div class="embed-container">
  <iframe
    src="about:blank"
    data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ"
    loading="lazy"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
    title="Placeholder video embed">
  </iframe>
</div>

*Replace `data-src` with the actual embed URL. The `loading="lazy"` attribute defers loading until the section is opened.*
