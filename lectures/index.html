  <h2>Trade Secrets</h2>
  <p>
    Trade secret law protects confidential business information that derives economic value from its secrecy. This section covers the foundations of the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA), the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), reasonable measures to maintain secrecy, and the intersection of trade secrets with employment law, digital assets, and innovation policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Professor Oranburg's forthcoming casebook <em>Protecting Trade Secrets</em> (Carolina Academic Press, 2026) forms the backbone of these materials.
